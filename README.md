# sysc-3110-project

## Installation and Usage:

1. Download and execute jar file onto any IDE.
2. Run the game from GameView.main()
3. When the game opens, first choose how many players you wish to play with from the drop down menu. 
    * If you fail to choose - hit cancel or closes on JOptionPane, the game will terminate.
4. After choosing the number of players, all players will be initialized on position GO, as shown on the top right corner of the GUI.
5. Hit the dice button on the centre of the board to roll and start the game.
6. Your position will move automatically, and the property you land on will prompt the property card frame to pop up.
7. If the player lands on a utilility or railroad (shown as light gray on the board), nothing will happen during their turn.
8. Player must close on the pop up that asks whether the player wants to purchase or not before the next turn occurs.
9. If a player chooses to purchase, the property will be added onto their property owned list on the bottom right panel.
10. The bottom right panel displays the current player's money and properties.
11. Player can click on their individual properties from the list to check the property information.
12. If the current player lands on another player's property, they have to pay rent. The player is notified via a pop up message. 
      * After the pop up message is  closed, the rent transaction will occur.
14. A player is automatically removed from the game if the player does not have enough money to pay rent.
      * When a player goes bankrupt and is removed from the game, all their properties become available to purchase again.
16. The game continues until the player closes out of the game, or when there is only one player left on the board.

## Milestone 2 Changes:

GUI based version of the Monopoly game. Designed the game in an MVC format.
Testing - Created test classes for each Model.


## Known Issues:

1. Current players can press the dice button without purchasing or not purchasing a property resulting them to roll again. Therefore, the limitation is the current player must use the CardFrame before rolling again.

2. The two panels on the right side of the GUI (PlayerStatePanel and PlayersPanel) change their sizes automatically after every few roll calls. This should not occur.

3. Donâ€™t skip to the next player right away, player might want to buy houses after rolling. (Milestone 3)

4. PieceComponent not yet implemented. The player pieces do not show up on the board yet. For now, PlayersPanel on the top right of the GUI displays the position of each player. 


## Remaining Deliverables:

Milestone 3: Additional features (jail, "Go", railroad, utility) and "AI" players. 

Milestone 4: Save/load features and customizable games.

## Roadmap Ahead:

Improvements for future Milestones:

* ColourGroup of properties needs to be fixed so that the player does not have to manually view the properties they have, to check if they own a colour group. 
* Need to add a Monopoly title on the centre of the Board.
* 3 doubles will send a player to jail from milestone 3.

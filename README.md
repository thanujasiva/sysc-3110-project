# sysc-3110-project

## Installation and Usage:

1. Download and execute jar file onto any IDE.
2. Run the game from GameView.main()
3. The game first starts with a pop up window asking if the user wants to reload a previous game. 
    - If user presses `YES` an Input window comes up asking to input the filename of the game that was saved.
    - If user presses `CANCEL` or `NO` the 'Choose Version' window pops up.
4. The 'Choose Version' window prompts the user to select a version of the Monopoly from a drop down menu.
    - User can choose from `Standard`, `Shuffled` and `International` options.
5. After selecting the version the game then asks for how many total players the user wants to play with, followed by a window which asks for the number of AI players the user wants.
   - If the user fails to choose (i.e. hits cancel or closes the JOptionPane) the game will terminate.
6. After choosing the number of players, all players will start on position `GO` of the board.
7. The user should click the dice button on the centre of the board to roll and start the game.
8. The player moves automatically on the board as shown by the player pieces.
   - The manual players are shown with the colour CYAN.
   - The AI players are shown with PINK and move on their own. The roll button will be disabled during and AI players' turn.
9. Any player that passes `GO` (the starting position) collects $200.
10. If the player lands on an ownable square (property/railroad/utilities) the corresponding card frame will pop up.                                                  
    -  The manual players have to press the `YES` button if they want to buy and the `NO` button for not buying.
12. If the player lands on a light grey tax box, the Game does not do anything.
13. If a player chooses to purchase an ownable square, the owned square gets added to their list of properties on the bottom right panel and the price amount gets deducted from their total money.
14. The bottom right panel also shows the current player number along with the up to date money they have.
15. Manual players can click on their individual properties from the bottom right panel to check the property information or to buy houses/hotels on them.
16. When a manual player owns all the properties of a colour set (for example, all properties of the green colour), they can buy houses on any of the properties of the colour set. 
    - Manual players must have equal number of houses on each property of the colour set, in order to buy the next house/hotel. This follows the 'Even Build' rule.
18. If the current player lands on another player's square, the corresponding card pops up showing the rent amount being paid on the top bar of the card frame.
    - After the `OK` button is pressed, the rent transaction will occur, and the money will be subtracted from their account and added to the owner's account.
    - The rent for each property is displayed it's property card.
    - The rent for the property increases as the player buys more houses or hotels.
    - The rent for utility is based on the dice rolled amount of the player who lands on it.
    - The rent for railroad increases with the number of railroads owned by a player.
19. Rolling doubles thrice or landing on the `Go to Jail` square will send the player to Jail.
  - For exiting jail, a manual player gets the option to pay a $50 fine or roll doubles in the first two rounds of staying in jail. If it is their third round, and they still do not roll doubles, they must pay a $50 fine to exit jail.
20. If the user wants to save the game and resume playing it later, at any point in the game, they can choose the `Save` option available from the menu bar of the window.
    - Clicking on `Save` prompts the user to input a filename where the game will be saved.
    - The user can resume the saved game by re-running the program and choosing to load a game at the begining.
21. A player goes bankrupt and is automatically removed from the game if the player does not have enough money to pay the rent or the jail exit fee.
    - When a player is removed from the game, all their properties become available to purchase again.
22. The game ends when there is only one player left on the board or when a user closes out of the game.
23. When a player wins, a window pops up congratulating the winner.


## Milestone 4 Changes:

Added save/load features.
    - The user can now save a game at any point in the game.
    - At the beginning, the user can load the saved game instead of starting a new one.

Hardcoded different versions of Monopoly in XML format.
    - User can choose from 3 versions:
        - Standard version is the standard monopoly board.
        - Shuffled version is the standard board but the squares are all shuffled.
        - International version is a European board with `£` currency.

Updated house feature so that manual players must have an equal number of houses on each property, of the same colour set, before proceeding to buy the next house/hotel (follows ‘Even Build’).

The handleJailTurn method in Game has been separated into three smaller methods to address the feedback.

New corresponding tests have been added.

Amount of rent to be paid now appears on the title of the Card Frame.


## Known Issues:

1. Utility has an empty implementation of getRent(int).
2. Board cuts off property squares at top and bottom.
3. The board shows only one (the most recent) player when both players land on the same property square.
4. All view classes should extend JFrame or JPanel (some classes contain a mainPanel or mainFrame, and others extend a JPanel or JFrame which is not consistent).
5. Have AI functionality (checks for if they want to buy ownable squares/houses) in PlayerAI and not in view.
